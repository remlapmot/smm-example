# Examples how to fit structural mean models
 
Based on the R code in the appendix of Clarke, Palmer, Windmeijer, Estimating Structural Mean Models with
Multiple Instrumental Variables Using the Generalised Method of Moments. Statistical Science, 2015, 30, 1, 96-177. https://dx.doi.org/10.1214/14-STS503 .

And adding fits using the [ivtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ivtools) package for comparison.
